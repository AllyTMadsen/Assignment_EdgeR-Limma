# Assignment_EdgeR-Limma
BF591 Project Assignment: running EdgeR and Limma on differential expression results from RNAseq data

Major Deliverables:
- performing differential expression analysis with two additional packages (edgeR and Limma) and comparing the results to DESeq2
- constructing volcano plots to compare the log2 fold-change and the adjusted p-value between the three analysis methods
